I have always wanted to visit Switzerland, the swiss alps, the chocolate and cheese, the diverse culture, you name it, and I have a dog named Byron, he is a Bernese Mountain Dog, one of the swiss breeds. So it makes Switzerland always stays at the top of my bucket list. I was actually planning to spend my summer holiday there in 2020 , however, covid made it impossible for me to complete my bucket list. Therefore, I choose Switzerland to be the country for a brief data analysis for COVID for one of my uni assignments, I guess it will give me insights into the current COVID situation in Switzerland so that I could re-plan my trip to there when the borders open.

## Data Description üìÑ

The five separate data sets used in the post were sourced from opendata.swiss, it is the Swiss public administration's central portal for open government data (opendata.swiss, 2021). Four of the five data sets were joined together to create a new data set call s_cov, it contains `r ncol(s_cov)` variables and `r nrow(s_cov)` observations. Data dictionary and number and percentage of missings in each variable are as follows:

|**Variable**      |**Class** |**Description**                    |
|:-----------------|:---------|:----------------------------------|
|geoRegion         |character |Country geocode                    |
|geoRegionName     |character |Country name                       |
|date              |date      |Date                               |
|daily_confirmed   |numeric   |Daily confirmed Covid-19 cases     | 
|daily_test        |numeric   |Daily total test numbers           |
|daily_pos_test    |numeric   |Daily total positive test          |
|daily_neg_test    |numeric   |Daily total negative test          |
|daily_total_deaths|numeric   |Daily total deaths                 | 
|daily_hosp        |numeric   |Daily total hospitalisation numbers|


```{r}
miss_var_summary(s_cov) %>% 
  datatable(options = list(pageLength = 4))
```

<br><br>

The other data set is call s_vac, it has `r ncol(s_vac)` variables and `r nrow(s_vac)` observations. Tables of Data dictionary and missing values in each variables are as follows:

|**Variable**      |**Class** |**Description**                                  |
|:-----------------|:---------|:------------------------------------------------|

As Figure \@ref(fig:map) (zoom in and hover over a country to see detailed infomation) shown below, Russian, French and the United Kingdom have the most confirmed cases, followed by Italy, Germany and Spain. Switzerland are amongst countries that have less confirmed cases. However, population needs to be taken in to account when making comparisons with the total number of confirmed cases for each countries.

### COVID-19 Figures in Switzerland (Feburary 2020 - August 2021) üìà

Table \@ref(fig:covid) (produced by DT) presents the total count of confirmed cases, test numbers, deaths and hospitalisation by month for both 2020 and 2021 in Switzerland (use the filter to filter out numbers in each column and the drop down box on the top left corner to display the entire table). The coloured bars in each column show the distribution of the data, the bulk of the data for confirmed cases, deaths and hospitalisation lie between October 2020 to January 2021 where as testing numbers have been remaining high since October 2020, this indicates that the Swiss government has beening doing a good job encouraging people to get tested. There has been a spike in confirmed cases and hospitalisation since the end of June, this is largely due to the highly infectious Delta variant that affecting the unvaccinated people (SWI swissinfo.ch, 2021). However there is a positive sign that the number of deaths has been maintain low so far.

### Vaccination Status in Switzerland üíâ

```{r vac-data-prep}
# 2020
s_vac_1 <- s_vac %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = vaccine,
              values_from = total_vac_admin) %>% 
  mutate(Year = year(date),
         Month = month(date)) %>% 
  filter(Year == "2020") %>% 
  group_by(Month, Year) %>% 
  summarise(across(c("moderna", "pfizer_biontech"), ~ sum(.x, na.rm = TRUE))) %>% 
  ungroup()


# 2021
s_vac_2 <- s_vac %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = vaccine,
              values_from = total_vac_admin) %>% 
  mutate(Year = year(date),
         Month = month(date)) %>% 
  filter(Year == "2021") %>% 
  group_by(Month, Year) %>% 
  summarise(across(c("moderna", "pfizer_biontech"), ~ sum(.x, na.rm = TRUE))) %>% 
  ungroup()

# join data for 2020 and 2021
s_vac_joined <- rbind(s_vac_1, s_vac_2) %>% 
  rename(Moderna = "moderna",
         Pfizer = "pfizer_biontech") 

s_vac_joined <- s_vac_joined[, c(2,1, 3, 4)]

```

The Moderna vaccine that being supplied to Europe is in fact manufactured in Switzerland by a Swiss firm called Lonza (House of Switzerland, 2021) and has become the most popular vaccine in Switzerland. This could be one of the factors that causes the average of doses administered for Moderna (26,555.32) was almost twice the amount of Pfizer (13,68.90) as well as the highest daily doses administered, 88,814 for Moderna and 37,954 for Pfizer, see Table \@ref(tab:sumstat). People may prefer vaccine that is manufactured in their home country rather than overseas. Another reason could be the approval for Moderna by the Swiss government in January this year after the approval for Pfizer in late 2020 and the Swiss drug regulator states that it showed 95% efficay in the trials (Miller, 2021), this may result in a spike in demand for the Moderna. Furthermore, Table \@ref(tab:sumstat) also shows that both vaccine data have a moderate positive skewness while the data for Moderna vaccine is more spread out.

```{r sumstat, fig.cap = "Vaccines Administered in Switzerland"}
s_vac_wide <- s_vac %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = vaccine,
              values_from = total_vac_admin) %>% 
    mutate(Year = year(date),
         Month = month(date)) %>% 
  filter(Year == "2021") %>% 
  rename(pfizer = "pfizer_biontech")


fun <- function(x) { 
  c(min = min(x), max = max(x), mean = mean(x), sd = sd(x, na.rm = TRUE), skewness = skewness(x, na.rm = TRUE)) 
  } 

sum <- summaryBy(moderna + pfizer ~ Year + geoRegin, data = s_vac_wide,
          FUN = fun) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = !Year,
               names_to = c(".value",
                            "Summary Statistics"),
               names_sep = "\\.")
  
sum$moderna <- round(sum$moderna, 2)
  
sum$pfizer <- round(sum$pfizer, 2)

sum %>% 
  select("Summary Statistics",
         "moderna",
         "pfizer") %>% 
  rename(Moderna = "moderna",
         Pfizer = "pfizer") %>% 
  kable(align='lcc',
        caption = "<center><strong>Summary Statistics of Vaccins Administered in 2021</strong></center>") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")) %>% 
  column_spec(1, width = "10em") %>% 
  column_spec(2, background = "#e4efe7") %>% 
  column_spec(3, background = "#f6dfeb") 


  
```

There were total of **`r format(sum(s_vac_joined$Moderna)+sum(s_vac_joined$Pfizer), scientific = FALSE)`** vaccines administered, beting **`r format(sum(s_vac_joined$Moderna), scientific = FALSE)`** and **`r format(sum(s_vac_joined$Pfizer), scientific = FALSE)`** Pfizer so far and that is roughly **`r round(((sum(s_vac_joined$Moderna)+sum(s_vac_joined$Pfizer))/(8606033*2))*100, 2)`%** of the population (8,606,033). Table 2 (produced by formattable) shows the total amount of vaccines administered in each month from December 2020 to August 2021, the deeper the colour the highest the number. There was a big increase in the number of Moderna doses since January and it had been increasing quite dramatically whereas the increases in Pfizer was not as significant as Moderna. However, the numbers for both vaccines continued to drop since June, the Swiss government had come up with solusion to boost the vaccination rate, as of October 1, the COVID test for all unvaccinated persons will no longer be free of charge (Schengenvisainfo, 2021), there could be an increase in the numbers in the future.
